# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Sprint Review and Retrospective for the SNHU Travel Project.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
To figure out what the user needs, I look at the user stories. I learn what they are asking and why they are asking for it. After I understand that, I can begin to figure out a reasonable solution to the problem. Sometimes, it may be different than what the user envisioned, but you try to get as close as possible, but within reason.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Before I really didn’t have a specific approach when developing programs, but after learning about the agile method I would like to incorporate that into the future. I like how versatile the agile method is and the values that it holds. I like how you are continuously testing your project and always adjusting your plan depending on what situations you run into.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe that being a team player makes you a good team member. You are working as a team, so the entire team takes responsibility. You have to make sure you pull your weight and work together. You shouldn’t be afraid to ask for help or give help when it is needed. You have to respect and understand your other team members. You have to understand that everyone is different and sometimes you aren’t going to agree with each other, but all you have to do is compromise. I believe these values are what makes you a good team member.
